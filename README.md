PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given the telematics data for each trip and the label if the trip is tagged as dangerous driving, derive a model that can detect dangerous driving trips.

1. Feature_generation.ipynb: Contains exploratory data analysis and feature engineering done for the dataset
2. Feature_selection.ipynb: Reducing features based on univariate selection, correlation and RFE
3. LightGBM model with hyperparameter tuning using Hyperopt
